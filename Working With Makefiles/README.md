# Working with Makefiles
## Assignment One

This description is to get you started on the Lab. We will keep updating this assignment description so that automatic grading can be done. The general structure of the assignment will remain the same. We will only  provide the C and Python Code  for the makefile to compile and run. The makefiles will not have to change significantly.

Update

We need you to submit a detailed Report so that it becomes easier for us to mark. The  marking scheme is as follows:
* Makefile running properly - 5
* Embedding in the source files - 2
* Report - 1
* Parameters in Makefile that are mentioned in the assignment - 1
* Creativity - 1
* Shell usage - 1 (Brownie points)

The report should contain the exact commands that we will run to evaluate and some brief description of the source codes written. We wont' be you for demo. We will take help of the report to evaluate your assignments. So you need to be careful while writing the commands.
