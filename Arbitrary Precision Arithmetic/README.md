# Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic
Arbitrary-Precision arithmetic, also known as "bignum" or simply "long arithmetic" is a set of data structures and algorithms which allows to process much greater numbers than can be fit in standard data types.
It should also work for negative numbers. You can use either sign magnitude or two's complement that you are have learnt/will learn in computer architecture course to do the assignment.

It should also support fractions (decimals).

This will be the basis for extending the codebase to support complex numbers when we do the next assignment.
